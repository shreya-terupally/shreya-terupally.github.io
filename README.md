# Shreya Terupally

Hello! Iâ€™m Shreya, a Masters student at the Language Technologies Institute in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon. My research interests center on AI deployment challenges, particularly in model interpretability, data privacy and improving AI accuracy. I aim to create solutions that ensure responsible AI use in practical contexts.

I completed my undergrad in CS from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), and worked as a software engineer at Uber for 2 years. At Uber, I was part of the Risk team, where I mainly worked on improving fraud detection systems from user insights and revenue data. Prior to that, I worked as an undergraduate researcher at Kohli Center of Intelligent Systems at IIIT Hyderabad, under [Prof. K Madhava Krishna](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/) and [Prof. Radhika Mamidi](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/radhikamamidi/).
