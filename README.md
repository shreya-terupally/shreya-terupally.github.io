# Shreya Terupally

Hello! Iâ€™m Shreya, a Masters student at the Language Technologies Institute in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon. My research interests are broadly in Deep Learning, Computer Vision and NLP, and anything in between. These days I'm interested towards AI deployment challenges like model reasoning and AI inaccuracies, and vision-language applications. I aim to create solutions that ensure responsible AI use in practical contexts.

I completed my undergrad in CS from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), and worked as a software engineer at Uber for 2 years. At Uber, I was part of the Risk team, where I mainly worked on improving fraud detection systems from user insights and revenue data. Prior to that, I worked as an undergraduate researcher at Kohli Center of Intelligent Systems at IIIT Hyderabad, under [Prof. K Madhava Krishna](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/) and [Prof. Radhika Mamidi](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/radhikamamidi/).
